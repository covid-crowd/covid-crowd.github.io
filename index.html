      <h2 class="display-4 mt-3">Help Predict COVID-19’s Spread in Your Community</h2>

      <p class="lead mt-3">High ranking epidemiologists assisting the CDC's lead modelers and state officials are building scientific models of COVID-19's future spread in your community. But, the models depend on knowing the social distancing measures in each of 3000+ counties in the United States. We urgently need volunteers to help us build a dataset of social distancing measures.</p>

          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>How is this data collected and verified?</h4>
          <p>All the data on this site has been collected from public news sources and government communications, either by our team or by volunteers like you. We manually check all the data contributed by volunteers. </p>
          <h4>I see incorrect or out-of-date information. What should I do?</h4>
          <p>The situation on the ground is changing rapidly. We expect that the data will need to be updated regularly. Whenever you see something that needs to be updated, please let us know using <a class="text-link" href="https://forms.gle/Rz9mLduNYutjELus9">this form</a>.</p>.
          <h4>What happens after I submit my contribution?</h4>
          <p>Our team is on call several times per day to verify the information that is submitted. After verification, we publish your contribution live on the website and in the public dataset. We appreciate your contributions!</p>
          <h4>How did you choose which data to collect?</h4>
          <p>We collaborated with epidemiologists producing models of local spread for COVID-19. The items being collected, including shelter-in-place orders, local religious gatherings, school closure, business closure, and the start dates of each, are the central components of their models for predicting COVID-19 spread. We opted to keep the data collection as lean as possible, the biggest "bang for the epidemiologists' buck", so that we could successfully collect across as many counties as possible.</p>
          <h4>How is this project different from the many other COVID-19 projects?</h4>
          <p>We are in touch with several other efforts, including those from Keystone and Wikidata, who also seek similar data. We have synchronized our schemas and are sharing the public data as quickly as possible. We welcome others to use the data we produce as well. Everyone's goal here is to get to a complete and accurate dataset as quickly as possible, and we welcome any efforts that allow us to work together toward that goal.</p>
          <h4>Why is crowdsourcing a good way to collect this data?</h4>
          <p>There are over 3,000 counties in the United States. Wikidata, Keystone, and others have on the order of tens to a few hundred counties covered. We need much, much more data in order to succeed at this epidemiological task. Luckily, this is also data that is known to residents of each county and searchable via the web - which is why we need your help!</p>
          <!--<h4>Other COVID-19 Resources</h4>
          <p>[not sure what's meant here]</p>-->
          <h4>Who is behind this project?</h4>
          <p>We are a team of computer scientists and epidemiologists who are assisting the CDC, DOD, and state officials in their COVID-19 planning and response efforts, and our work is briefed to senior federal officials. The epidemiologists on our team have previously supported responses to the 2009 flu pandemic and other epidemiological crises. Funding for this project was provided by a <a class="text-link" href="https://computational-epidemiology.org/">National Science Foundation Expeditions Grant</a>. Sub-Contract funding (ARA): Scalable Analytics for Decision Support.</p></p>
          <p>Our team: Jacob Ritchie, Tum Chaturapruek, Mark Whiting,, J.D. Zamfirescu-Pereira, Mitchell Gordon, Jackie Yang, Tianshi Li,  Amy Zhang, Catherine Mullings, Rajan Vaish, Golrokh Emami, Danae Metaxa, Mandy Wilson, Achla Marathe, Stephen Eubank, Madhav Marathe, Michael Bernstein.</p>
