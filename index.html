          <p>We are a team of computer scientists and epidemiologists who are assisting the CDC, DOD, and state officials in their COVID-19 planning and response efforts, and their work is briefed to senior federal officials. The epidemiologists on our team have previously supported responses to the 2009 flu pandemic and other epidemiological crises. Funding for this project was provided by a <a class="text-link" href="https://computational-epidemiology.org/">National Science Foundation Expeditions Grant</a>.</p>
