        Look at the <b class="text-link" onclick="openTab('results-button', 'Results')">data we've gathered so far</b> or fill out our <b class="text-link" onclick="openTab('survey-button', 'Survey')">
        survey</b>!
      </p>
      <p>In order to respond effectively to COVID-19, scientists need to contruct models of how it spreads and what policies can effectively contain its spread.</p> 

      <p>Since different policies are being enacted by all 3000+ counties in the United States, we need volunteers to help us gather information on exactly what's happening around the country.</p> 

      <p>Filling out our survey about what is going on (for any county in the United States) and how much people are following social distancing policies in your own community.</p> 

      <p>We are a team of computer scientists and epidemiologists who are assisting the CDC, DOD, and state officials in their COVID-19 planning and response efforts, and their work is briefed to senior federal officials. The epidemiologists on our team have previously supported responses to the 2009 flu pandemic and other epidemiological crises.</p>
